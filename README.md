Hangman is a classic word-guessing game typically played between two or more players. Here's a description of how the game is usually played:

**Objective**: The objective of Hangman is for one player to guess the word chosen by another player within a certain number of guesses.

**Setup**:
1. One player (the "chooser") selects a word, phrase, or sentence, keeping it secret from the other player(s).
2. The chosen word is represented by a series of dashes, one for each letter in the word. For example, if the chosen word is "apple", it would be represented as "_ _ _ _ _".

**Gameplay**:
1. The other player (the "guesser") starts by guessing a letter that they think might be in the word.
2. If the guessed letter is in the word, the chooser reveals all occurrences of that letter in the word. For example, if the guess is "p", the word "apple" would now be displayed as "_ p p _ _".
3. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of a hangman diagram is drawn. This typically starts with a gallows and a blank space for the head. With each incorrect guess, a new body part (such as the head, body, arms, and legs) is added to the hangman diagram, representing a step closer to being fully "hanged."
4. The guesser continues to guess letters one at a time until either they successfully guess the word or the hangman diagram is completed (indicating failure).
5. If the guesser successfully guesses the word before the hangman diagram is completed, they win. If the hangman diagram is completed before the word is guessed, the chooser wins.

**Variations**:
- **Number of Guesses**: Players can decide on a fixed number of guesses allowed before the game ends.
- **Categories**: Players can limit the words to certain categories like "animals," "countries," or "movies."
- **Customization**: Some versions of Hangman allow for customization of the hangman diagram, with players often drawing more complex and creative figures.

Hangman is a simple yet engaging game that challenges players' vocabulary and deductive reasoning skills. It can be played casually or competitively, making it a popular choice for both children and adults alike.
